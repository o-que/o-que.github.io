          “Surrounded, detached, in measureless oceans of space,<br>
          <br>
          Ceaselessly musing, venturing, throwing, seeking the spheres to connect them”<br>
          <br>
          ─ Excerpt from A Noiseless Patient Spider by Walt Whitman, 1868<br>
          <br>
          These lines of Whitman’s poem are referring to his soul which, like a spider web, strives to create connections.
          Even though the poem was written centuries before the internet was created, I felt like those lines really reflected
          the World Wide Web which is why I wanted to incorporate them into my project. The colorful circles approaching the
          center of the web are my abstract representation of flies. The spider represents the users of the web/internet.
          The chaotic display of the text showcases how vast and abundant with information the internet is that people can
          often get lost in it. The spider can also get lost in the spider web as its web gets larger and more intricate.
          The spider is consumed by its own creation just like we are with ours.

        <h4>ARTIST STATEMENT</h4>
        <div class="artiststatement">
          <p>
            I play with computational systems such as code and artificial intelligence to create interesting and unexpected things. I want to blur the boundaries between art and design, creating work that is useful, visually engaging, and a medium
            for personal expression. I especially like code as a medium because it can be super functional, creative, and unpredictable. My projects frequently deviate from my original plans as I experiment with the script and while I may find myself
            facing walls in my exploration I also find exciting new possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Most of my work is centered around my personal experiences. I tend to orbit hyper specific events in my life. I obsess over the memories, and on each rethinking the memory is restructured and distorted. The distortion becomes solidified
            and definition is added to the new imagining of the event. It begs the question, am I orbiting these events because they’re inherently significant or are they significant to me because I orbit them? I am absolutely fascinated by the
            elaborate web of activity connecting and manipulating past, present, and future. This applies to both an individual and universal scale. I use videography to explore and express these events and the impact they have on me. I want to share
            the stories I’ve held onto throughout my life, in a style that reflects the hazy, distorted, nonlinear, and precarious way that I remember them.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for aesthetics, I love algorithmically precise structures and movements being morphed into organic and chaotic distortions. My influences include sacred geometry, biochemistry, and psychedelia. I play a lot with symbolism and hidden
            narratives in my projects. I love working with animation because it is immersive, engaging, and shows a process of change. I use trails and webs both for their aesthetic and their conceptual utility. I admire the psychedelic imagery they
            create, the complex interlinking of elements and how that imagery conceptually represents the ideas of recording, recalling, and the web of causality.
          </p>
          <p>
            My use of lines is reflective of my interest in cellular automata, the idea of incredibly simple elements to create complexity, meaning, and dynamism. Waves, spirals, grids, and other common motifs in my art are extrapolations of the
            line. Waves are especially compelling to me because they simultaneously represent light, sound, electromagnetism, and possibly all matter in the universe. Kaleidoscopic visuals intrigue me because of the complicated, ever evolving, even
            vibrating, sequence of patterns. An infinite amount of very complex and different configurations arise from very simple lines and shapes. The creation of new things through the warping and mirroring of the preexisting further reflects my
            conceptual interests in connections, distortions and movement.
