        <h4>ARTIST STATEMENT</h4>
        <div class="artiststatement">
        <p>
          I play with computational systems such as code and artificial intelligence to create interesting and unexpected things. I want to blur the boundaries between art and design, creating work that is useful, visually engaging, and a medium for personal expression. I especially like code as a medium because it can be super functional, creative, and unpredictable. My projects frequently deviate from my original plans as I experiment with the script and while I may find myself facing walls in my exploration I also find exciting new possibilities.

          Most of my work is centered around my personal experiences. I tend to orbit hyper specific events in my life. I obsess over the memories, and on each rethinking the memory is restructured and distorted. The distortion becomes solidified and definition is added to the new imagining of the event. It begs the question, am I orbiting these events because they’re inherently significant or are they significant to me because I orbit them? I am absolutely fascinated by the elaborate web of activity connecting and manipulating past, present, and future. This applies to both an individual and universal scale. I use videography to explore and express these events and the impact they have on me. I want to share the stories I’ve held onto throughout my life, in a style that reflects the hazy, distorted, nonlinear, and precarious way that I remember them.

          As for aesthetics, I love algorithmically precise structures and movements being morphed into organic and chaotic distortions. My influences include sacred geometry, biochemistry, and psychedelia. I play a lot with symbolism and hidden narratives in my projects. I love working with animation because it is immersive, engaging, and shows a process of change. I use trails and webs both for their aesthetic and their conceptual utility. I admire the psychedelic imagery they create, the complex interlinking of elements and how that imagery conceptually represents the ideas of recording, recalling, and the web of causality.

          My use of lines is reflective of my interest in cellular automata, the idea of incredibly simple elements to create complexity, meaning, and dynamism. Waves, spirals, grids, and other common motifs in my art are extrapolations of the line. Waves are especially compelling to me because they simultaneously represent light, sound, electromagnetism, and possibly all matter in the universe. Kaleidoscopic visuals intrigue me because of the complicated, ever evolving, even vibrating, sequence of patterns. An infinite amount of very complex and different configurations arise from very simple lines and shapes. The creation of new things through the warping and mirroring of the preexisting further reflects my conceptual interests in connections, distortions and movement.
